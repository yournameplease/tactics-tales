--- Plays a sound effect.
--- [View Online](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/picotron_manual.html#sfx)
--- @param n integer The index of the sound effect to play (0-63). -1 stops the sound effect on the channel. -2 stops the sound effect and clears the channel state.
--- @param channel? integer The channel to play the sound effect on (0-15).
--- @param offset? integer The offset in the sound effect to start playing from (0-63 in notes).
--- @param length? integer The length of the sound effect to play in notes (0-63).
--- @param pan? integer The panning of the sound effect (-128 to 127).
--- @param mix_volume? integer The volume of the sound effect (0-255). Takes priority over the value at `0x553a`.
function sfx(n, channel, offset, length, pan, mix_volume) end

--- Plays music starting from a specific pattern.
--- @param n integer The pattern to start from. -1 stops playback.
--- @param fade_len? integer How long it takes to fade between two songs in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.
--- @param channel_mask? integer A bitfield which specifies which channels from the song will play. Defaults to 255.
--- @param base_address? integer The address of the sfx to play from.
--- @param tick_offset? integer The starting offset from the given pattern that music will begin playing at in ticks.
function music(n, fade_len, channel_mask, base_address, tick_offset) end

--- This provides low level control over a channel. It is useful in more niche situations, like audio authoring tools and size-coding.
--- Internally this is what is used to play each row of a sfx when one is active. Use 0xff to indicate an attribute should not be altered.
---     pitch     channel pitch (default 48 -- middle C)
---     inst      instrument index (default 0)
---     vol       channel volume (default 64)
---     effect    channel effect (default 0)
---     effect_p  effect parameter (default 0)
---     channel   channel index (0..15 -- default 0)
---     retrig    (boolean) force retrigger -- default to false
---     panning   set channel panning (-128..127)
